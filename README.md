# Welcome to my project page
The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate to RTS my usage of Ansible. This is a bit of a departure from my typical usage of Ansible as I would use the third-party modules to talk to network hardware (Juniper and Fortigate). Nevertheless, the purpose of this mini-project is to configure three seperate servers in AWS:
1. Web server
2. App server
3. Database server

The setups are fairly simple and meant to get the skeletons of the servers stood up and able to communicate appropriately (you can see more details in the comments of the YAML file).

There's definintely a good chunk missing that I would like to delve into deeper (logging, IAM, pulling code), but this was a fun exercise nonetheless.
